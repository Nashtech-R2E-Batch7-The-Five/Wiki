### components/

### libs/
This directory includes shared libraries and utility functions that are used across multiple parts of the application. These could include helper functions, constants, and other shared logic.

### providers/

### services/
This directory houses services that interact with external APIs or handle complex business logic. These services are designed to be reusable and to encapsulate the data fetching and processing logic.

### styles/
Contains global styles, theme definitions, and CSS modules used throughout the application to maintain a consistent look and feel.

### utils/
This folder includes utility functions and modules that provide generic, reusable functionality. These utilities are typically stateless and can be used across various parts of the application.
